# 4A Motor Shield
## Introduction
The 4A Motor Shield is based on the Free scale MC33932 dual H-Bridge Power IC , which can control inductive loads with currents up to 5.0A peak per single bridge. By using this shield, you are able to drive two DC motors with Arduino/Seeeduino board, controlling the speed and direction of each one independently. You can also measure the motor current absorption of each motor, among other features.

The on board DC/DC converter support a very wide range of input voltage, and can provide a 5V power supply for the microcontroller board with 100mA maximum current. So, you just need one power supply to drive the motors and power up the logic circuit.

|Item|Name|Description|
|:---:|:---:|---|
|1|**J1**|DC Input connector.|
|2|**J2**|Motor Driver output connector.|
|3|**EN, FT**|Jumpers for EN control and Fault flag detection. If short-circuit the EN jumper, the EN signal will be mapped to the D4 pin ,you are able to control the H-Bridge disable output or reset the Fault flag by D4 pin. If short-circuit the FT jumper, the fault flag signal will be mapped to D3 pin ,you are able to read the fault flag from the D3 pin ether.|
|4|**IO**|Logic Voltage level Selecting Jumper.|
|5|**IA, IB**|Current sensor jumper. If you want to detect the motor current, one way is to short-circuit these jumpers. The motor current will be converted into voltage signal and can be read from A0,A1 pin.|
|Other|**Power Supply** |The shield is powered up from the J1(DC input connector).The input voltage range is 6Vdc ~ 28Vdc.The on board DC/DC converter can convert the DC input voltage to 5Vdc output voltage to supply the logic circuit. The DC/DC converter can also power up the microcontroller board(Arduino/Seeeduino) form "5V" pin for maximum 100mA current.|
|Other|**Motor Interface**|Out 1 and Out 2(Out 3 and Out 4) connect Motor A(B) for DC Motor.|

!!!WARNING
    Do not touch the H-bridge IC or PCB board during working. Its temperature can reach up to 100 Celsius degrees in the case of full load operating.
